			<h1>
				The competition is free.
				The industry is moving fast.
				And we’re making a brand-new, fully native, web development editor just for the Mac.
				<br><br>
				What are we thinking?
			</h1>
			
			<section>			
				<p>Twelve years ago we introduced Coda, the world’s first web development editor. It put the tools you needed to make a web page together in one app, and nobody had ever done that before.</p>
				<p>But a lot has changed since then. Websites are now more like applications in the way they're built and run. Deployment is much more complex than an FTP upload. Languages, frameworks, toolchains — and possibilities — have exploded.</p>
				<p>We had to make a difficult choice: rewrite Coda for this new world, or leave it behind?</p>
				<p>We’ve been making apps for a long time. And we never stopped having a passion for creating beautiful, functional, useful tools that help people do their very best work.</p>
				<p>It’s what we are. It’s why we’re here.</p>
				<p>So, you can probably guess what we chose. </p>
				<p>Later this year, we’ll be releasing a preview of our next Mac web editor, one you can try for yourself.</p>
				
				<h2>Is it any good?</h2>
				<p>So far, yes. We think so. We’re using it every day.</p>
				<p>There are substantial new modern editor features, like multiple cursors, highlighting for identifiers, tag pairs, and brackets, editor overscroll, improved autocomplete, and more. </p>
				<p>There’s publishing to multiple destinations. A sidebar for build issues. Themes for the entire workspace. A new Terminal. </p>
				<p>And since it’s Mac native, it’s super smooth and hyper responsive, designed to get your work done as quickly as possible. It’s also way faster than Coda 2 — up to 40 times faster when parsing files and indexing a project.</p>
				<p>Most intriguingly, there’s still a lot we’re not quite ready to talk about — innovative new ways that our next editor can help you with your entire web development workflow.</p>

				<h2>How can we compete?</h2>
				<p>That’s a fair question. Many of our competitors are free, and we really rely on, well, revenue.</p>
				<p>But if there’s anything we believe, it’s this: when you build an amazing product that helps people be happier doing their jobs every day, you’ll find the customers you need to keep it going.</p>
				<p>Just look at Transmit, our file transfer client, which is still being actively developed, 20 years later.</p>
				<p>We know we’ll never crush the big guys. We won’t even be on Windows. But that’s OK, because crushing anything has never really been a goal. Instead, we’re working hard to give you something really amazing. Something you’ll use every day. Something worth switching to.</p>
				
				<h2>But change is always hard.</h2>
				<p>It’s not all great news. Our next editor will be entirely redesigned, which for Coda 2 users means some re-learning of how the app works. It was important for us to make it fast, modern, free of bloat, and out-of-your-way so you can work quickly. That meant totally starting over.</p>
				<p>Plus, some features from Coda 2 will be going away — at least for now — like the MySQL client and visual CSS editing.</p>
				<p>But we’re going to be moving fast. Iterating constantly. Listening to feedback daily. This is an app that won’t be standing still. And we’re counting on you to guide us.</p>
				
				<h2>And, it won’t be called Coda.</h2>
				<p>Yes, the next Coda is so different it won’t even be called Coda.</p>
				<p>Frankly, we were worried that developers may have tried Coda in the past, decided it wasn’t for them, and written the app off forever. This new version is so new, it deserves a fresh start.</p>
				<p>And then, incredibly, a new Coda arrived on the scene — a reimagined document at <a href="http://coda.io/">coda.io</a> — and we reached an agreement to let them have the name. They’re Coda now. And we’re free to look to the future.</p>
				<p>So the next Coda won’t be “Coda”. So what will it be?</p>
				
				<h2>It will be very special.</h2>
				<p>Yeah, it’s true, we do things a little… differently here at Panic. But we love the Mac. We love building professional tools. And we love helping you do your best work.</p>
				<p>Our next editor will be here before you know it.</p>
